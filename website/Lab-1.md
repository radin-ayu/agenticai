Files used in lab can be downloaded from the following links:
-  [Procurement Requisition Rules.docx](./pdfs/Procurement%20Requisition%20Rules.docx)
- [Supplier Sales Report for Procurement.docx](./pdfs/Supplier%20Sales%20Report%20for%20Procurement.docx)

1. Select "Create from scratch", give your agent a unique name (make sure to identify yourself by your initials or name, since this is a shared instance), e.g. "[Your Initial]_Supplier_Researcher Agent", and fill in the description as shown below: 

    ```
    You are a helpful supplier researcher that uses tools to answer questions precisely after doing thorough research on google and document search. The google search tool can provide customer sentiment on the suppliers. The document search tool has the procurement requisition rules and past year supplier review.
    ```

1. Test your agent in the preview chat on the right side by asking the following questions and validating the responses.  They should look similar to what is shown in the screenshot(s) below:

    ```
    Which supplier out of Excelentia Supplies and Global Office Supplies is viable to buy product Xtralife from. Give a list of pros and cons of each supplier
    ```
    ```
    Which supplier should i choose? i want an urgent delivery.
    ```

1. You can try the following sample questions as well:

    ```
    how many days of leave am i entitled to?
    ```
    ```
    can i work from home 3 times a week?
    ```
    ```
    does the company provide any assistance on loan repayments?
    ```
    Notice that you get a generic answers based on policy for all employees. You will see in the next lab how you can connect it to Employee Address Agent and Leave Management Agent from Lab 1 to do tasks for you.

**Congratulations! You've built your RAG Agent.**
