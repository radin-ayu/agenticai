# üßë‚Äçüíº Supplier Research Lab 1: Building a RAG agent
    
In this lab, you will build a Supplier Researcher Agent using Watsonx.ai Agent Lab. This agent will allow you to research the suppliers for procuring Xtralife based on past supplier performance, procurement rules and customer reviews.

Files used in lab can be downloaded from the following links:
-  [Procurement Requisition Rules.docx](./pdfs/Procurement%20Requisition%20Rules.docx)
- [Supplier Sales Report for Procurement.docx](./pdfs/Supplier%20Sales%20Report%20for%20Procurement.docx)

1. Select "Create from scratch", give your agent a unique name (make sure to identify yourself by your initials or name, since this is a shared instance), e.g. "[Your Initial]_Supplier_Researcher Agent", and fill in the description as shown below: 

    ```
    You are a helpful supplier researcher that uses tools to answer questions precisely after doing thorough research on google and document search. The google search tool can provide customer sentiment on the suppliers. The document search tool has the procurement requisition rules and past year supplier review.
    ```

1. Test your agent in the preview chat on the right side by asking the following questions and validating the responses.  They should look similar to what is shown in the screenshot(s) below:

    Which supplier out of Excelentia Supplies and Global Office Supplies is viable to buy product Xtralife from. Give a list of pros and cons of each supplier
    ```
    ```
    Which supplier should i choose? i want an urgent delivery.
    ```
